Frontend Developer Task - Responsive Landing Page
  This README provides an overview of the frontend development task I completed as part of the interview process. The task involved creating a responsive landing page design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, based on a Figma design provided.

Task Overview
  The task was to convert a Figma design into a functional HTML webpage with a focus on responsive design principles. The design included various sections, a pricing card, a footer, and a "Get Started" button that triggers a modal popup with a functional form. The form data needed to be submitted via AJAX to a specified url.

Steps Taken
Here is an overview of the steps I took to complete the task:

1.Gathering Resources:

    I began by accessing the Figma design file provided to understand the layout and design elements.
2.Resource Organization:

    I collected all the required images and assets from the Figma design and saved them in a dedicated folder within the project directory.
3.HTML Structure:

    I created the HTML file, defining the structure of the landing page.
4.Styling:

    I used CSS and Bootstrap to style the page, ensuring that it looked visually appealing and closely matched the design in Figma.
5.Responsiveness:

    I focused on making the design responsive by testing and adjusting styles for various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
6.Header and Navigation:

    I implemented the header, including the logo and navigation menu, initially for desktop and later made it responsive for all devices.
7.Sections:

    I created four sections with images and content, each with a unique background.
8.Pricing Card:

    I used Bootstrap to create a pricing card, ensuring it displayed correctly on all screen sizes.
9.Footer:

    I designed the footer, including the company logo, copyright notice, and social media icons.
10.Modal Popup and Form:

    I implemented the "Get Started" button to trigger a modal popup.
    Inside the modal, I designed and validated a functional form using JavaScript.
     When users submitted the form, I used AJAX to send the data to a specified URL for processing.
11.Toast Notifications:

    To provide user feedback, I added toast notifications for success and error messages upon form submission.
12.Clear Form Function:

    I included a function to clear the form after submission for a better user experience.
Challenges Faced
   During the task, I encountered a few challenges:

     Responsive Design: Ensuring the design looked great on all screen sizes, especially mobile devices.

     AJAX and Form Submission: Implementing AJAX for form submission while handling success and error responses was a bit complex but was crucial for user interaction.

Conclusion
    This task provided an excellent opportunity to demonstrate my frontend development skills, including responsive design, Bootstrap usage, and AJAX form submission. It allowed me to apply best practices in web development and overcome challenges to create a fully functional and visually appealing landing page.
